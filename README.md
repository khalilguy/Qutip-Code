# Circuit-Opimization-Using-Deep-Learning

This is project is to create a reinforcement learning model which can optimize quantum circuits in the presence of noise. At the moment, the workable code consists of a brute force algorithm which 
finds the most optimal circuit layout in a noisy environment. This is run hrough the `main.py` file.
